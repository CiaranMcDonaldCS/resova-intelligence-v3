# Competitive Strategy: Beating ROLLER iQ

## Executive Summary

ROLLER just announced ROLLER iQ (November 2025) - an AI assistant for the attractions industry. We need to position Resova AI Analytics as the **superior intelligence platform** that goes deeper, provides more actionable insights, and delivers measurable ROI.

## ROLLER iQ: What They're Offering

Based on their press release:

### Their Strengths
- **Industry-Specific AI**: Built specifically for attractions (not generic ChatGPT)
- **Real-Time Data**: Grounded in venue's operational figures
- **Accessible Everywhere**: Desktop + mobile app
- **Natural Language**: Ask questions, get instant answers
- **Ecosystem Play**: Bundled with pricing automation and channel management

### Their Positioning
- "Turn data into instant insights"
- "Intelligence as a competitive edge"
- "Move from analysis to action in seconds"
- Questions like: "What products are driving revenue growth?" and "What changes based on guest feedback?"

## How We Beat Them

### 1. **Deeper Intelligence - Dual Analysis Engine**

**ROLLER iQ**: Single-dimension analysis (revenue, bookings, feedback)
**Resova AI**: **Multi-dimensional intelligence** that connects the dots

**Our Advantage:**
```
Revenue Analysis + Capacity Utilization + Activity Profitability
         ↓
Complete Business Picture
```

**Example Question:**
- **ROLLER iQ**: "What products are driving revenue growth?"
  - *Answer*: "Zip Line increased 15% vs last month"

- **Resova AI**: "Which activities should I expand?"
  - *Answer*: "Zip Line Adventure shows 89.2% capacity utilization AND highest revenue per booking ($87.50). You're leaving $280/week on the table by not adding a 2pm session. Meanwhile, Kayak Tours has only 43% utilization with $52/booking - consider consolidating or eliminating low-performing time slots."

**Winner**: We provide **actionable intelligence** (what to do), not just **data** (what happened).

### 2. **Granular Operational Intelligence**

**ROLLER iQ**: Broad strokes ("revenue growth", "guest feedback")
**Resova AI**: **Time-slot level precision**

**Our Unique Data:**
- Peak times by hour (>80% utilization)
- Low-demand slots (<50% utilization)
- Per-activity capacity efficiency
- Session count optimization
- Staff allocation insights

**Business Impact:**
- Identify exactly which 8am Kayak Tour to eliminate (saving $450/week)
- Know precisely when to add Zip Line sessions (generating $280/week)
- Optimize staff scheduling based on actual demand patterns

**Winner**: We tell you **exactly what to change**, they tell you **something changed**.

### 3. **Profit-First Mindset**

Every response is structured around **ROI**:

```markdown
### Recommended Actions

**1. Add Peak Sessions (Easy, High ROI)**: Schedule additional Zip Line
session at 2pm. Expected +$280/week.

**2. Consolidate Low Performers (Medium, Immediate Impact)**: Combine
8am and 5pm Kayak Tours. Save $450/week in staffing.

**3. Dynamic Pricing (Easy, Quick Win)**: 15% discount for 4-5pm slots.
Potential +$320/week.
```

Each recommendation includes:
- **Difficulty level** (Easy/Medium/Hard)
- **Expected impact** (dollars per week/month)
- **Implementation timeframe**
- **ROI calculation**

**Winner**: We focus on **profit**, not just "insights".

### 4. **Visual Intelligence**

**Automatic chart generation** for every response:

```json
<CHARTS>
[
  {
    "type": "bar",
    "dataSource": "capacity_by_activity",
    "title": "Capacity Utilization by Activity",
    "description": "Shows which activities are efficiently using capacity"
  }
]
</CHARTS>
```

Charts are:
- Context-aware (generated based on the question)
- Exportable (CSV download)
- Interactive (hover for details)
- Presentation-ready

**Winner**: We **show** insights visually, not just describe them.

### 5. **Conversational Depth**

After every response, we provide **3-4 contextual follow-up questions**:

```
### Follow-up Questions
- Which specific Kayak Tours time slots should I eliminate?
- What's the revenue impact of adding that 2pm Zip Line session?
- How does my utilization compare to last month?
- Which activities have the best profit margin per booked spot?
```

This creates a **guided discovery experience** where operators can dig deeper naturally.

**ROLLER's Approach**: One-off Q&A
**Our Approach**: Conversational journey to insights

**Winner**: We create **engagement**, they provide **answers**.

### 6. **Industry Expertise Built-In**

Our AI is positioned as a **15-year industry veteran**:

```
You are a senior business advisor for tour and activity operators,
with 15+ years of experience helping venue owners and managers grow
their businesses.
```

Every response includes:
- **Industry benchmarks** ("Industry standard is 35-45% retention")
- **Seasonal considerations** (understands booking patterns)
- **Operational reality** (knows about staffing, capacity, margins)
- **Best practices** (proven strategies from the industry)
